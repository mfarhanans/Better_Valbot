[UPDATED 12TH APRIL 2021]


Valbot is VERY easy to use.

Firstly, you should put Valbot and all of the assets you downloaded into its OWN folder. Name it something like Valbot (that's a good idea isn't it?)

Then need to run the PackageInstaller.bat as admin if it is your first time running the bot. This installs all dependencies for the bot to function.
You can do this by right clicking PackageInstaller.bat and pressing "Run as administrator". Let it run and then it will close when it is finished.

Then you need to find the shortcut you use to run Valorant to get into the game.
It should look like this (https://ibb.co/Qfn2sdM) or on your desktop, like this (https://ibb.co/t46ScYL).
Copy this shortcut and put it in the SAME FOLDER that you made in the first step. It should look like this (https://ibb.co/7NYnFXT)

Now you can run the bot! You can do this by running "Valbot.py"
When you load it you will see different options, make sure to read everything, and then start the bot by pressing 1 and enter.

The console will tell you what is happening with the bot, it should open Valorant if you have not already opened it and make it the focused window.

Some users, like myself, have issues with the bot detecting the images so make sure Valorant is in windowed fullscreen for the bot to function.

If there are any problems with the bot such as an update in progress or if the bot has been detected, I will manually STOP the bot from use.
It will resume as soon as I give it the go-ahead again so don't worry about having to restart the bot.

If you have any problems please join the discord server (https://discord.gg/QFC46XKzxU) and ask in the help channel.

Thank you for all the support everyone.

Remember Valbot will ALWAYS be free. I have put many hours of my own time into this bot so if you wish to donate to help me out, please message me on Discord (Fums#0888). 

Thanks friends!
