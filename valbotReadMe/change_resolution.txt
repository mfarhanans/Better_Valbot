Simple text on how to change the bots resolution detection::


The base bot only works with 1920x1080 monitors. There is a way to make it work with any resolution:

What you need to do is go inside the assets folder and get your own version of all the images in the
correct resolution. This will ensure that Valbot can detect the correct pixel match images.


Then after doing this you need to go inside bot.py and replace:

	self.cheaterdetected_png = Image.open(requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrFums/ValbotAssets/main/valbot_assets_1920_1080/cheated_detected.png", stream=True).raw)
	self.continueterminated_png = Image.open(requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrFums/ValbotAssets/main/valbot_assets_1920_1080/continue_terminated.png", stream=True).raw)
	self.deathmatch_png = Image.open(requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrFums/ValbotAssets/main/valbot_assets_1920_1080/deathmatch.png", stream=True).raw)
	self.ingame_png = Image.open(requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrFums/ValbotAssets/main/valbot_assets_1920_1080/ingame.png", stream=True).raw)
	self.inqueue_png = Image.open(requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrFums/ValbotAssets/main/valbot_assets_1920_1080/inqueue.png", stream=True).raw)
	self.ondeathmatch_png = Image.open(requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrFums/ValbotAssets/main/valbot_assets_1920_1080/ondeathmatch.png", stream=True).raw)
	self.play_png = Image.open(requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrFums/ValbotAssets/main/valbot_assets_1920_1080/play.png", stream=True).raw)
	self.playagain_png = Image.open(requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrFums/ValbotAssets/main/valbot_assets_1920_1080/playagain.png", stream=True).raw)
	self.start_png = Image.open(requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrFums/ValbotAssets/main/valbot_assets_1920_1080/start.png", stream=True).raw)
        


With this:

        self.cheaterdetected_png = "assets/cheated_detected.png"
        self.continueterminated_png = "assets/continue_terminated.png"
        self.deathmatch_png = "assets/deathmatch.png"
        self.ingame_png = "assets/ingame.png"
        self.inqueue_png = "assets/inqueue.png"
        self.ondeathmatch_png = "assets/ondeathmatch.png"
        self.play_png = "assets/play.png"
        self.playagain_png = "assets/playagain.png"
        self.start_png = "assets/start.png"



Where to find the different images:

cheater_detected.png :: When you have a screen that says cheater detected. This is the CHEATER DETECTED text.
continue_terminated.png :: When you have a screen that says cheater detected. This is the CONTINUE button. (NOT USED IN 2.2+)
deathmatch.png :: After clicking the play button, it is ONLY the text that says DEATHMATCH
inqueue.png :: After a game has been found, there will be a countdown before the match starts, it is the party not ready text where the start button / inqueue text normally is
ondeathmatch.png :: After clicking the play button and then deathmatch, it is the text and lower crest that says DEATHMATCH
play.png :: The big play button in the main menu
playagain.png :: When a match has finished and you have the xp screen, it is at the bottom of the screen
start.png :: After you have clicked the play button, it is as the bottom of the screen and says START



That is as much help as I can give you with this, I hope this helped to all the non 1920x1080 native users :D
